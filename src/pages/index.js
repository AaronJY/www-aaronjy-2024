        <h2>Tech I Like</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Web Development:</strong> I primarily use Node.js with TypeScript
            (or JavaScript for smaller projects) alongside Next.js to build websites
            and applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scripting:</strong> My preferred scripting languages are Python
            and JavaScript, as I&apos;m well-versed in them and they offer extensive
            libraries that typically cover my needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>API and Backend Development:</strong> For more robust API or backend
            architecture, I often choose .NET Core with C# and ASP.NET. The strongly-typed
            nature of C# and the structured framework of ASP.NET help maintain clean and
            organised code.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cloud Hosting:</strong> When possible, I opt for hosting on a
            DigitalOcean droplet. If more extensive cloud services are required, I usually
            opt for Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which I find more user-friendly than Azure
            or AWS. I also self-host services on shared server hosting running Ubuntu Server, typically with Hetzner.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>About this site</h2>
        <p>www.aaronjy.me is a static site (i.e. a bunch of HTML, JS, CSS and image files) written in JavaScript using Next.js. Tacit is being used as a micro CSS framework, and various smaller bits of custom CSS have been applied on top.</p>
        <p>The site is hosted inside a Google Cloud Storage bucket with a load balancer sat in front of it. The load balancer is required as Cloud Storage doesn&apos;t support a) custom domains, b) HTTPS out of the box or c) a global CDN solution.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest benefits of a website made of simple static files and assets is that I can deploy it easily, almost anywhere, and for very little money.</p>
