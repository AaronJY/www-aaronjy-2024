# Doctor Who episodes (2005 - 2014)

All doctor who episodes (eventually) between 2005 and 20014 ranked into tiers. Anything after 2014 with Peter Capaldi as The Doctor isn't included, as they're so bad I refuse to acknowledge their existence ðŸ¤“

Tiers are:

* **S**: Stellar, amazing, groundbreaking, no notes.
* **A**: Overall pretty damn good. Not quite reaching into S tier.
* **B**: Better than the average Dr. Who episode. Nothing amazing, but a bit better than run-of-the-mill. 
* **C**: Your bog-standard Who. Nothing special.
* **D**: Bit of a let-down, but we've had worse...
* **E**: Bottom of the barrel. You wouldn't watch these if you had a choice.
* **F**: Absolute dog shit, laughably bad, what were they thinking?
