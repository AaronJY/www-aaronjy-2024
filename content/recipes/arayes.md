## You will need

- 1 white onion
- 2 garlic cloves
- lebanese black pepper spice
- lebanese mixed spices

## Method

1. Blend together parsley, onion, garlic, olive oil
2. Mix the meat with the spices (to taste) and mix in the mixture from the first step to make a kofta mixture
3. Stuff the kofta mix into the the lebanese bread (as thick or as thin as you like, though I prefer a thin layer of kofta)
4. Fry the kofta-stuffed bread on both sides in a thin layer of oil (or paint the oil on the bread on each side before adding to the pan)
